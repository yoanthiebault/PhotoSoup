# PhotoSoup

PhotoSoup is made to merge photos from several sources with potentially wrong timezones to one clean directory.
In concrete terms, it:
- Ask for the different source directories
- Copy all photos to one directory and rename them from 0 to N by chronological order

It can also apply a time patch to each source directory in order to fix a potential wrongly setup camera.
